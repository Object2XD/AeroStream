Research

The Material Research Team conducted two studies (quantitative and qualitative) with over 200 participants to understand their perspectives of five different carousel designs. The studies measured their understanding of how to interact with each carousel, their expectations of the number of items in each design, and how they expected carousels to be used.

**Summary of findings:**

*   Participants thought carousels were a good way to explore many different kinds of content

*   A previewed or squished item strongly indicated that there was more content to swipe through

*   Participants expected around 10 items in a carousel that scrolled multiple items at once

*   While some contexts were considered better for some carousel designs, all designs were considered similarly usable
