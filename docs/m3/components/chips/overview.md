*   Use chips to show options for a specific context

*   Four variants: assist Assist chips represent smart or automated actions that can span multiple apps, such as opening a calendar event from the home screen. , filter Filter chips use tags or descriptive words to filter content. They can be a good alternative to toggle buttons or checkboxes. , input Input chips represent discrete pieces of information entered by a user, such as Gmail contacts or filter options within a search field. , and suggestion Suggestion chips help narrow a user’s intent by presenting dynamically generated suggestions, such as suggested responses or search filters.

*   Chip elevation Elevation is the distance between two surfaces on the z-axis. [More on elevation](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/elevation/overview) defaults to 0 but can be elevated if they need more visual separation

*   Shape: Rounded rectangle

*   Variants: Action chips have been separated into assist chips Assist chips represent smart or automated actions that can span multiple apps, such as opening a calendar event from the home screen.  and suggestion chips Suggestion chips help narrow a user’s intent by presenting dynamically generated suggestions, such as suggested responses or search filters. .
