*   Typography and spacing: Titles and labels are larger and have increased spacing to accommodate 48dp target size

*   Color: New color mappings and compatibility with dynamic color Dynamic color takes a single color from a user's wallpaper or in-app content and creates an accessible color scheme assigned to elements in the UI. [More on dynamic color](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/dynamic/choosing-a-source)

*   Variants: The three variants of date pickers have been renamed to not be device-dependent.
